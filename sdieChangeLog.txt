v1.24 (Latest Version):
• Fixed the way the program cleans its files. 
	--it would previously delete "udid.txt" resulting in a missing file error.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.23:
• If iTunes is installed in a directory other than the default path, it should automatically detect it
---------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.22:
• Fixed a bug that allowed the program to not start properly after exit
---------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.21:
• Fixed a very small error to prevent people from cleaning files when device enters recovery mode.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.20:
• Fixed some errors when saving the output file
• Added additional errors to help clarify some issues
• Greatly improved speed of detecting whether device is in recovery mode or not
• Previously, when the save dialog pops up, some buttons will get disabled if you clicked 'Cancel' rather than 'Save'
	--essentially, the program kinda forced you to save the file. This update fixes that issue.
• Improved file cleaning process
	--previously, the cleaning process was very messy and inefficient. It caused some false errors to pop up.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
